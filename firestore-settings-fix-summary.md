# Firestore Settings Configuration Fix Summary

## Problem
You were encountering a Firestore warning about settings being changed after initialization. The warning appeared because Firestore settings can only be configured before the first use of the Firestore instance.

## Root Cause
In the original `FirebaseService.swift` implementation:
```swift
private let db = Firestore.firestore()  // This initialized Firestore immediately

private init() {
    // Settings were being configured AFTER Firestore was already initialized
    let settings = FirestoreSettings()
    settings.cacheSettings = PersistentCacheSettings()
    db.settings = settings  // Too late!
}
```

## Solution
Changed the `db` property to be initialized during the `init()` method, ensuring settings are configured before getting the Firestore instance:

```swift
private let db: Firestore  // Just declare the property

private init() {
    #if canImport(FirebaseFirestore)
    // Configure settings BEFORE getting Firestore instance
    let settings = FirestoreSettings()
    settings.cacheSettings = PersistentCacheSettings()
    
    // Now get Firestore instance with settings already configured
    let firestore = Firestore.firestore()
    firestore.settings = settings
    self.db = firestore
    #endif
}
```

## Results
- ✅ Build succeeded without errors
- ✅ Firestore settings are now properly configured before initialization
- ✅ The warning about changing settings after initialization should no longer appear

## Testing
Created a test script at `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/PlateUp_v2/test-firestore-settings.sh` to verify the fix works correctly at runtime.

## Next Steps
1. Run the test script to verify no Firestore warnings appear
2. Monitor the app logs during normal usage to ensure settings are applied correctly
3. The app should now properly use persistent cache settings for offline functionality
