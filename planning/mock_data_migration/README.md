# Mock Data Migration Project

## Overview
This project aims to migrate all mock data in PlateUp to real data sources, creating a fully functional app with live user data.

## Quick Start

1. **Review Current State**: Check OVERVIEW.md for all identified mock data areas
2. **Choose an Agent Task**: Pick an agent file based on your expertise
3. **Follow Architecture**: Use data_flow_architecture.md for system design
4. **Track Progress**: Update task_tracking.md as you complete tasks

## Priority Order

1. **Foundation First**: Create core services (PatternAnalysis, Micronutrient, etc.)
2. **Progress & Analytics**: Most visible to users in Momentum tab
3. **Micronutrients**: Critical for meal window recommendations
4. **AI Insights**: Enhances user experience significantly
5. **Dashboard**: Ties everything together

## Key Decisions Needed

- [ ] Which food database API to use for micronutrients?
- [ ] Firebase schema approval
- [ ] Cloud Functions vs client-side calculations
- [ ] Caching strategy and retention policies
- [ ] Mock data fallback for demo mode?

## Success Metrics

- All features display real user data
- No hard-coded values in production
- Performance maintained or improved
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1 (Foundation): 1 week
- Phase 2 (Feature Migration): 2-3 weeks  
- Phase 3 (Testing & Optimization): 1 week
- **Total: 4-5 weeks**

## Getting Started

1. Review the OVERVIEW.md for context
2. Check architecture/data_flow_architecture.md
3. Pick an agent task to work on
4. Update shared/task_tracking.md with progress
